Ex-copywriter turned aspiring web developer with a passion for cultivating clean code in line with Agile Methodologies, XP standards and industry best practices.

I'm looking to work in a positive and collaborative environment that allows me to continue building on the solid foundations and diverse skills that I've laid down in an intensive 4 months at Makers Academy.


## Skills

#### Communication

I believe that the difference between passable and great code is the ability to efficiently communicate  purpose. Like good writing, good code should tell a story that a reader with even a basic grasp of the language can understand and feel able to actively engage with.

* Writing

  Through several years of copywriting experience I've honed a sophisticated command of written language and established the expertise to convey a complex idea or chart a literary narrative in clear and understandable english.

  I've applied this in the production of everything from vast features (such as an 11,000 word piece detailing the story of Gibraltar's civilians during WW2), right down to punchy marketing straplines, used to convey convoluted concepts in just a few words.

* Coding

  I find myself applying an editorial eye to my code on a daily basis, which has repeatedly proven an invaluable tool, allowing me to quickly identify repetition, improper syntax and opportunities to refactor. I strive to create coherent code that states clear intent and that a third party could comfortably contribute to without a need for additional explanation.

* People

  I believe that colleagues and pair-partners gain the most from each other when all parties are encouraged to give feedback and to question anything they might not understand or agree with. I myself feel it is my obligation to let a colleague know if their code is not clear to me and likewise welcome such feedback as an opportunity to improve.


#### Outside the box thinking

  - Having the confidence to take a step back from a problem and a willingness to try a completely different approach is a crucial skill for a developer. Some of my proudest moments to date have been finding a way round, instead of through, a particularly labrynthine problem.

  - Working as a copywriter in advertising, I generated multitude of original and far-ranging ideas for advertorial campaigns. This bolstered my ability for creative, outside the box thinking that I've been able to apply on several occasions throughout group projects at Makers academy.

   <!-- e.g. (size recognition in Playfest, Baby Got Slack) -->

  <!-- - Repeatedly called on, throughout my adult life and including at Makers, to proof, edit and otherwise improve my friends' and colleagues' written work. -->

<!-- - Communication (giving/encouraging feedback, writing,
  passionately believe that if the purpose of a piece of code isn't immediately clear, then it needs to be refactored or rewritten. -->
