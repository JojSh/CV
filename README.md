Copywriter turned software developer with a passion for cultivating clean code. 2 years coding experience to date, with 20 months on the job as a Front-end JavaScript Engineer.

I'm looking to work in a positive, collaborative environment that promotes continued learning and provides opportunities to hone my craft and to build on my skillset with new technologies.


## Skills

#### Communication

I believe that the difference between passable and great code is in how effectively it can communicate intent. As with good writing, good code should tell a human-readable story that an audience of any level can understand and feel able to engage with.

* Writing

  Over several years of copywriting experience I've honed a sophisticated command of written language and established the expertise to convey a complex idea, or to chart a literary narrative in clear and understandable terms.

  I've applied this in the production of everything from vast features, down to punchy marketing strap-lines, required to convey convoluted concepts in just a few words.

* Coding

  I find myself applying an editorial eye to my code on a daily basis, which has repeatedly proven an invaluable tool, allowing me to quickly identify repetition, improper syntax and opportunities to refactor. I strive to create coherent code that states clear intent and to which a third party could comfortably contribute without the need for additional explanation.

* People

  I believe that colleagues and peers gain the most from one another when feedback is encouraged and fostered, and where individuals feel comfortable questioning things they do not understand or agree with. I feel it is an obligation to let a colleague know if their code has room for improvement and likewise to welcome such feedback as an opportunity to improve.


#### Outside the box thinking

  - Having the confidence to take a step back from a problem and the willingness to try a completely different approach is a crucial skill for a developer. Some of my proudest moments to date have been finding a way round, instead of through, a particular problem.

  - Working as a copywriter in advertising, I collaborated to create far ranging ideas for advertorial campaigns. This bolstered my ability for creative, outside-the-box thinking that I've been able to apply on several occasions throughout group projects at Makers academy.
